ðŸš—Electric Vehicles Analysis Dashboard using POWER BI !!

I am thrilled to announce that I have completed a Power BI project which involved analysis and visualisation of growth of electric vehicles over the years.

Key findings:

ðŸ‘‰Growth over the years of EV Vehicles: A sharp rise is seen in 2023 with a sharp decline in 2024.However,a gradual rise is seen between 2010 and 2018.

ðŸ‘‰Market share: Tesla leads the market share followed by Nissan and Chevrolet.

ðŸ‘‰Popular models: Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 dominate the market follower by Nissan's Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt EV.

ðŸ‘‰State wise distribution: California has the highest number of EV customers, while other states show varying levels of growth

This project helped me in showcasing my visualisation skills, dashboard designing and unlocking key insights.
